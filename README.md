## Protease cleavage site specificity analysis - PICS
This is a small code for cleavage site specificity analysis

If you have any problem running the code you can check the following:
1 - pay attention to the conflicts between the packages used here and those ones you have appended.
2 - run the sessionInfo() to see the versions of each package used.
3 - of course, check the names of your files peptide.tsv and protein.fas. Sometimes people change names.

You will find the Rscript for build a matrix of frequency for each amino acid per position.
